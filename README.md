## Send Your First Shutterized Transaction

1. Add the _Encrypting RPC Server_ for Chiado to your wallet (for Metamask, click "Settings" -> "Networks" -> "Add Network" -> "Add a network manually"). Use the following settings:

| Network Name       | Shutterized Chiado                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| RPC URL            | https://erpc.chiado.staging.shutter.network |
| Chain ID           | 10200                                       |
| Currency Symbol    | XDAI                                        |
| Block Explorer URL | https://gnosis-chiado.blockscout.com        |

2. Make sure the RPC is selected.

3. Send a transaction!

4. Optional: Observe it in the [sequencer contract](https://gnosis-chiado.blockscout.com/address/0xd073BD5A717Dce1832890f2Fdd9F4fBC4555e41A). It's encrypted though, so there's not much to see.
